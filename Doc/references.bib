  abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury is one of the main causes of drug attrition. The ability to predict the liver effects of drug candidates from their chemical structures is critical to help guide experimental drug discovery projects toward safer medicines. In this study, we have compiled a data set of 951 compounds reported to produce a wide range of effects in the liver in different species, comprising humans, rodents, and nonrodents. The liver effects for this data set were obtained as assertional metadata, generated from MEDLINE abstracts using a unique combination of lexical and linguistic methods and ontological rules. We have analyzed this data set using conventional cheminformatics approaches and addressed several questions pertaining to cross-species concordance of liver effects, chemical determinants of liver effects in humans, and the prediction of whether a given compound is likely to cause a liver effect in humans. We found that the concordance of liver effects was relatively low (ca. 39−44\%) between different species, raising the possibility that species specificity could depend on specific features of chemical structure. Compounds were clustered by their chemical similarity, and similar compounds were examined for the expected similarity of their species-dependent liver effect profiles. In most cases, similar profiles were observed for members of the same cluster, but some compounds appeared as outliers. The outliers were the subject of focused assertion regeneration from MEDLINE as well as other data sources. In some cases, additional biological assertions were identified, which were in line with expectations based on compounds’ chemical similarities. The assertions were further converted to binary annotations of underlying chemicals (i.e., liver effect vs no liver effect), and binary quantitative structure−activity relationship (QSAR) models were generated to predict whether a compound would be expected to produce liver effects in humans. Despite the apparent heterogeneity of data, models have shown good predictive power assessed by external 5-fold cross-validation procedures. The external predictive power of binary QSAR models was further confirmed by their application to compounds that were retrieved or studied after the model was developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for chemical toxicity prediction that applied QSAR modeling and other cheminformatics techniques to observational data generated by the means of automated text mining with limited manual curation, opening up new opportunities for generating and modeling chemical toxicology data.},

  abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury, although infrequent, is an important safety concern that can lead to fatality in patients and failure in drug developments. In this study, we have used an ensemble of mixed learning algorithms and mixed features for the development of a model to predict hepatic effects. This robust method is based on the premise that no single learning algorithm is optimum for all modelling problems. An ensemble model of 617 base classifiers was built from a diverse set of 1,087 compounds. The ensemble model was validated internally with five-fold cross-validation and 25 rounds of y-randomization. In the external validation of 120 compounds, the ensemble model had achieved an accuracy of 75.0\%, sensitivity of 81.9\% and specificity of 64.6\%. The model was also able to identify 22 of 23 withdrawn drugs or drugs with black box warning against hepatotoxicity. Dronedarone which is associated with severe liver injuries, announced in a recent FDA drug safety communication, was predicted as hepatotoxic by the ensemble model. It was found that the ensemble model was capable of classifying positive compounds (with hepatic effects) well, but less so on negatives compounds when they were structurally similar. The ensemble model built in this study is made available for public use.},

  abstract = {Hepatic toxicity is a key concern for novel pharmaceutical drugs since it is difficult to anticipate in preclinical models, and it can originate from pharmacologically unrelated drug effects, such as pathway interference, metabolism, and drug accumulation. Because liver toxicity still ranks among the top reasons for drug attrition, the reliable prediction of adverse hepatic effects is a substantial challenge in drug discovery and development. To this end, more effort needs to be focused on the development of improved predictive in-vitro and in-silico approaches. Current computational models often lack applicability to novel pharmaceutical candidates, typically due to insufficient coverage of the chemical space of interest, which is either imposed by size or diversity of the training data. Hence, there is an urgent need for better computational models to allow for the identification of safe drug candidates and to support experimental design. In this context, a large data set comprising 3712 compounds with liver related toxicity findings in humans and animals was collected from various sources. The complex pathology was clustered into 21 preclinical and human hepatotoxicity endpoints, which were organized into three levels of detail. Support vector machine models were trained for each endpoint, using optimized descriptor sets from chemometrics software. The optimized global human hepatotoxicity model has high sensitivity (68\%) and excellent specificity (95\%) in an internal validation set of 221 compounds. Models for preclinical endpoints performed similarly. To allow for reliable prediction of “truly external” novel compounds, all predictions are tagged with confidence parameters. These parameters are derived from a statistical analysis of the predictive probability densities. The whole approach was validated for an external validation set of 269 proprietary compounds. The models are fully integrated into our early safety in-silico workflow.},

It is also one of the major reasons of drug withdrawal from the market. Thus, DILI has become one of the most important concerns of drugs, and should be predicted in very early stage of drug discovery process. In this study, a comprehensive data set containing 1317 diverse compounds was collected from publications. Then, high accuracy classification models were built using five machine learning methods based on MACCS and FP4 fingerprints after evaluating by substructure pattern recognition method. The best model was built using SVM method together with FP4 fingerprint at the IG value threshold of 0.0005. Its overall predictive accuracies were 79.7 \% and 64.5 \% for the training and test sets, separately, which yielded overall accuracy of 75.0 \% for the external validation dataset, consisting of 88 compounds collected from a benchmark DILI database – the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base. This model could be used for drug-induced liver toxicity prediction. Moreover, some key substructure patterns correlated with drug-induced liver toxicity were also identified as structural alerts.},
