    <Name>Estimation of flash point and autoignition temperature of organic sulfur chemicals</Name>
    <Description>The combustible nature of organic sulfur containing chemicals demands an accurate hazardous knowledge for their safe handling and application in industries and researches. In this work, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) study was performed to thoroughly investigate such crucial hazardous properties i.e., flash point (FP) and autoignition temperature (AIT) of the organic sulfur chemicals which are comprising a wide range of mercaptans, sulfides/thiophenes, polyfunctional C,H,O,S material classes. Based on multivariate linear regression (MLR) the multivariate model was gained using a robust binary particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the feature selection step, the three molecular descriptors were realized as the most responsible descriptors for the flammability behaviors of such chemicals. Next, a three-layer feed-forward neural network model (ANN model) was utilized. The implemented multivariate linear regression and three-layer feed-forward neural network models were practically able to predict the flammability characteristics of a diverse range organic sulfur containing chemicals with high accuracy.</Description>
