        <Description>The PBT Index is a macro-variable which condenses the chemical cumulative tendency to environmental persistency, bioaccumulation and (eco)toxicity. It is derived by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from half-life, BCF and P. promelas toxicity experimental and reliable predicted data for a set of 180 heterogeneous organic chemicals. The scores of the compounds along PC1, which provides alone the largest part (77.1%) of the total information, defined the PBT Index; this index ranks the compounds according to their cumulative Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic behavior.</Description>
