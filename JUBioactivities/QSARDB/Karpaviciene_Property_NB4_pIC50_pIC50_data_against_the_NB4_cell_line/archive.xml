    <Name>Synthesis and antiproliferative activity of a-branched a,b-unsaturated ketones in human hematological and solid cancer cell lines</Name>
    <Description>A series of a-branched a,b-unsaturated ketones were prepared via boron trifluoride etherate mediated
reaction between arylalkynes and carboxaldehydes. The evaluation of the antiproliferative activity over
hematological (NB4) and solid cancer (A549, MCF-7) cell lines provided a structure-activity relationship.
5-Parameter QSAR equations were built which were able to explain 80%-92% of the variance in activity.
The resulting selective lead compound showed IC50 value 0.6 mM against the hematological cell line and
did not cause apoptosis, but blocked cell cycle in G0/G1. Moreover, it was demonstrated that this
compound enhances and accelerates retinoic acid induced granulocytic differentiation.</Description>
