    <Name>Prediction of PAH mutagenicity in human cells by QSAR classification</Name>
    <Description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous pollutants of high
environmental concern. The experimental data of a mutagenicity test on human
B-lymphoblastoid cells (alternative to the Ames bacterial test) for a set of 70 oxo-,
nitro- and unsubstituted PAHs, detected in particulate matter (PM), were
modelled by Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) classification
methods (k-NN, k-Nearest Neighbour, and CART, Classification and Regression
Tree) based on different theoretical molecular descriptors selected by Genetic
Algorithms. The best models were validated for predictivity both externally and
internally. For external validation, Self Organizing Maps (SOM) were applied
to split the original data set. The best models, developed on the training set
alone, show good predictive performance also on the prediction set chemicals
(sensitivity 69.2–87.1%, specificity 62.5–87.5%). The classification of PAHs
according to their mutagenicity, based only on a few theoretical molecular
descriptors, allows a preliminary assessment of the human health risk, and the
prioritisation of these compounds.</Description>
