    <Name>Estimation of aqueous solubility of organic compounds by using the general solubility equation</Name>
    <Description>The general solubility equation (GSE) proposed by Jain and Yalkowsky was used to estimate aqueous solubility of
1026 non-electrolytes. The only parameters used in the GSE are melting points (MP) and octanol–water partition
coeﬃcients (Kow). No ﬁtted parameters and no training set are employed in the GSE. The experimental solubility values
were taken from the AQUASOL dATAbASE. The average absolute error and the root-mean-square error in the
solubility estimates are 0.38 and 0:53 log units, respectively. Thus, with an observed MP and calculated Kow ; the users
can obtain a reasonable estimation of the aqueous solubility of any organic non-electrolyte.</Description>
