    <Name>Quantitative structure-activity relationships for the developmental toxicity of haloacetic acids in mammalian whole embryo culture</Name>
    <Description>Developmental toxicity in mouse whole embryo culture assay has been reported for acetic acid (AA) and a series of ten haloacetic acids, including mono-, di-, tri-fluoro (MFA, DFA, TFA), chloro (MCA, DCA, TCA), bromo [MBA, DBA, TEA), and monoiodo (MIA) acetic acids. Benchmark concentrations (BCm), calculated as the lower 95% confidence limit of molar acid concentration producing a 5% increase in embryos with neural tube defects, provided potency estimates for development of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). The best overall regression was obtained for the ten halo-acids (excluding AA] and related log(1/BCm) to the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E(Iumo)) and acid dissociation constant (pKa) with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.97, and a sample size-adjusted r(2) = 0.92. This QSAR suggested a common basis for the mechanism of HA activity, which would imply additivity for mixtures of these acids. Examination of QSARs for subsets of the total data set (e.g., monohaloacids) highlighted parameter relationships embedded in the total QSAR, helping to unravel the separate contributions of E(Iumo) and pKa to the overall potency. The relevance of these parameters is discussed in terms of postulated mechanisms of developmental toxicity involving changes in intercellular pH and redox metabolism. The whole embryo assay results pertain to direct embryo exposure and toxicity without the confounding influence of maternal factors. The resulting QSAR model offers possible insight into the mechanism of embryo toxicity that will hopefully contribute to understanding of the more complex, in vivo teratogenicity problem.</Description>
