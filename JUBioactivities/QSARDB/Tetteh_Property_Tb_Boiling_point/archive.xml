    <Name>Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships for the Estimation of Boiling Point and Flash Point Using a Radial Basis Function Neural Network</Name>
    <Description>Radial basis function (RBF) neural network models for the simultaneous estimation of flash point (Tf) and boiling point (Tb) based on 25 molecular functional groups and their first-order molecular connectivity index (1χ) have been developed. The success of the whole modeling process depended on a network optimization strategy based on biharmonic spline interpolation for the selection of an optimum RBF neurons (n) in the hidden layer and their associated spread parameter (σ). The RBF networks were trained by the Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) learning algorithm. After dividing the total database of 400 compounds into training (134), validation (133), and testing (133), the average absolute errors obtained for the validation and testing sets ranges from 10 °C to 12 °C and 11 °C to14 °C for Tf and Tb, respectively, and are in agreement with the experimental value of about 10 °C. Results of a standard Partial Least Square (PLS) regression model for single output predictions range from 23 °C to 24 °C and 18 °C to 20 °C for Tf and Tb, respectively, indicating the superior predictive ability of the neural model and strongly suggests that a nonlinear relationship exists between the input and target parameters of the data. The robustness of the neural model was successfully examined by a random split cross validation based on pooling together of the validation and test data sets. The study shows that the simple numerical coding of a molecule based on its formula together with its 1χ is an attractive way of estimating the flammability properties of organic compounds via an RBF neural network</Description>
