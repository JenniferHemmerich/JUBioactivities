    <Name>QSAR models of quail dietary toxicity based on the graph of atomic orbitals</Name>
    <Description>Graphs of atomic orbitals (GAOs) have been used to represent molecular structures. We describe rules to convert the labelled hydrogen-filled graphs (LHFGs) into GAOs. The GAO is one possible way of taking account of the structure of atoms (i.e., atomic orbitals, such as 1s1, 2p2 and 3d10) for QSPR/QSAR analyses. Optimization of correlation weights of local invariants (OCWLI) of the LHFGs and the GAOs was used to obtain a method of quail dietary toxicity modelling. Statistical characteristics of the models based on the OCWLI of GAO are better than those based on the OCWLI of the LHFGs.</Description>
