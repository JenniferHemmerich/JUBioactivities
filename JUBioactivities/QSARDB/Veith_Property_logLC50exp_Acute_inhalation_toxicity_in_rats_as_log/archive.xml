    <Name>A baseline inhalation toxicity model for narcosis in mammals</Name>
    <Description>This paper presents the results of an analysis of the rodent inhalation literature
and the development of a quantitative structureâ€“activity relationships (QSAR)
model for 4-hour LC50 as baseline toxicity to complement the baseline toxicity
model for aquatic animals. We used the same literature review criteria developed
for the ECOTOX database which selects only primary references with explicit
experimental methods to form a high-quality database. Our literature review
focused on the primary references reporting a 4-hour exposure for a single species
of rodent in which the chemical had been clearly tested as a vapour and for which
the exposure concentrations were not ambiguous. An expert system was used
to remove reactive chemicals, receptor-mediated toxicants, and any test that
produced symptoms inconsistent with non-polar narcosis. The QSAR model
derived for narcosis in rodents was log LC50 = 0.69 X log VP + 1.54 which had an
r 2 of 0.91, which is significantly better than the baseline toxicity model for aquatic
animals. This simple model suggests that there is no intrinsic barrier to estimating
baseline toxicity for in vivo endpoints in mammalian or terrestrial toxicology.
