    <Name>Predicting partitioning of volatile organic compounds from air into plant cuticular matrix by quantum chemical descriptors</Name>
    <Description>Based on theoretical linear solvation energy relationship and quantum chemical descriptors computed by AM1 Hamiltonian, a new model is developed to predict the partitioning of some volatile organic compounds between the plant cuticular matrix and air.</Description>
