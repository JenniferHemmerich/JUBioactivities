Each folder contains 4 descriptor files and 1 SD structure file.
Activities are included in each descriptor file. Note: For yeast dataset, there are several kind of activities.
Descriptors are recalculated after the workshop and might give out slightly different results.

Mut: Mutagenicity This data set is collected from various public sources like EPA, NIH, etc.
Yeast: Yeast Anticancer This data set is obtained from http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/yacds.
    All  compounds  in  this  data  set  were  screened  against  six kinds of mutant strains
Tox: Acute Toxicity data set This data set contains 278 substituted benzenes. The IC50 toxicity to T. pyriformis is used
       as the toxicity end point
NCI: NCI AntiHIV Drug Screen data set: (NCI): This data set is obtained from http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/docs/aids/aids_data.html.
