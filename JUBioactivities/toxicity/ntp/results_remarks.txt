CORRECTIONS AND CHANGES :

Mixtures:

We tried to separate this mixtures as far as there were given separate structures and  results for each substance (for example, TR021, Aldrin and Dieldrin, were separated in TR021a: Aldrin and TR021b: Dieldrin).
When there was only one result for a mixture of two or more substances, we
removed structures and results (e.g. Diesel fuel (TR310: mixture of
carbohydrate compounds) or Chloraminated water (TR392: reaction to several
compounds in water)). 

Double Entries:

The most relevant entries were used (e.g. first entry of TR-440, TR-431
instead of TR-250, TR-194 instead of TR-197 & 199)

Non-standardized Studies:

Studies with unusual protocols (e.g. promotor studies) were removed 

TR numbers of classifications and structures were synchronized
