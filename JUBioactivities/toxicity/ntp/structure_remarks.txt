Remarks about structures in the smiles code

1) General

-The configuration at asymmetric centres is not distinguished

-No distinction is made between the constitution at C=C double bonds

-Shown structures do not necessarily represent the main tautomers at pH = 7

-Bonds to metal atoms are always considered to be single bonds

-Mixtures were either seperated (see results_remarks.txt) or deleted

-Polymers and compounds with undefined structures were removed

-Small sperate entities like crystal water, HCl or H2SO4 were removed

2) Specials

-Nitro groups '[N+](=O)[O-]' are always written with charges

-Amino groups 'CN' are never written in the protonated form, although they might be protonated in reality

-Sulphuric acids 'S(=O)(=O)O[Na]' or carboxylic acids 'C(=O)O[Na]' are always written without charges but with bonding to metal ions

-These metals might be part of the structure: 
 Na
 K       TR336
 Ca      TR163
 Ba      TR225
 Zn      TR238
 B       TR324
 Sn      TR139, TR183
 As      TR345
 In      TR499
 Pb      TR151
 Te      TR152
